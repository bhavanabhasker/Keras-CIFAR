# Keras-CIFAR
Training CIFAR images using KERAS 

## Objective 

The program trains the CIFAR images using KERAS and compares the accuracy.  

For the sample network in the notebook an accuracy of approx. 62% is achieved. 

Model is evaluated against pre trained weights from VGG, ResNet and Inception. 

ResNet and Inception models shows an training accuracy of 100%
